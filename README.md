# Arduino-Based Hand Gesture Robot  

This project is a hand gesture-controlled robot featuring a rover module and a claw mechanism. The robot interprets hand movements using an **ADXL335 accelerometer** and transmits control signals via an **NRF24L01 transceiver** for wireless communication. The **L298N motor driver** controls the rover‚Äôs movement, while **servo motors** operate the claw. A **flex sensor-based switching mechanism** allows seamless toggling between rover mode and claw mode.  

üèÜ **Achievements:**  
- **1st place** in the **EEE Department Hardware Project Competition**, where all Hardware Workshop projects were evaluated.  

üîß **Tools & Components Used:**  
- **Microcontroller:** Arduino  
- **Sensors:** ADXL335 accelerometer, flex sensor  
- **Wireless Communication:** NRF24L01 transceiver  
- **Motor Control:** L298N motor driver, servo motors  

This project demonstrates expertise in **embedded systems, wireless communication, and robotics**. üöÄ
